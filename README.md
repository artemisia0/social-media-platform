**Here is a short video on how this web app looks like**
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nKhiJRHbc6g/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/nKhiJRHbc6g)

## Features
- user can sign in, sign up and sign out from his account
- user can upload images and describe them (like a post)
- profile data is editable through the convenient modal
- images are stores directly in DB :( so it works not so fast)
- responsive and simple web design
- other features are presented in video (link is above)

## Tech stack
- next.js
- @apollo/client + ws (GraphQL client over web sockets)
- jotai (state management)
- iron-session (session management)
- shadcn (ui library)

## Important notes
- I have a repository which name is 'social-media-website-api' and it is an API server written for this web app (I deploy this app and API server separately on different hosts)
